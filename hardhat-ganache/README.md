# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract.

Make sure to setup a local ganache network.

To deploy the Hello contract:

```shell
npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network localganache
```

To compile (not needed if you already used deploy)

```shell
npx hardhat compile
```
